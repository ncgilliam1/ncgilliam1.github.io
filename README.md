Nathaniel Gilliam (ncgilliam1@my.waketech.edu)

My Github was created for my CTI-110 class at WTCC. 

My repository 'ncgilliam1.github.io' will be used to store and commit project files for this class. 

I created the repository on the web view of Github, and then downloaded the desktop application for Github. Within the application,
I selected "Clone a repository" from the options, and selected my online repository to download to my local files.
