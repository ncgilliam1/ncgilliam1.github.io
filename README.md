Nathaniel Gilliam (ncgilliam1@my.waketech.edu)

My Github was created for my CTI-110 class at WTCC. 

My repository 'ncgilliam1.github.io' will be used to store and commit project files for this class. 

I created the repository on the web view of Github, and then downloaded the desktop application for Github. Within the application,
I selected "Clone a repository" from the options, and selected my online repository to download to my local files. 

# About Me
I am a student at Wake Technical Community College, and enjoy working with computers. I think programming is a fun and engaging activity involving problem solving and tons of creative thinking! I'm hoping to finish an associates degree in Computer Science at Wake Tech, and maybe work in game development! 

## My Interests
I grew up playing the piano and enjoy making music when I can find the time. I also enjoy making graphic art, even though I don't do it professionally. If I have free time outside of work and school, I enjoy playing video games or just being lazy and watching T.V.
